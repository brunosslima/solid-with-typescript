# solid-with-typescript

This repository was created as a case study for the S.O.L.I.D. course using TypeScript.

It is a shopping cart developed without using SOLID principles, which is in the legacy/shopping-cart-legacy.ts file and then refactored by applying its principles, which will be in the src/solid folder.
